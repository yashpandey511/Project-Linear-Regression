In this project, we explore how income relates to lifestyle scores by using a method called linear regression. We have a dataset with two columns: one for income and another for lifestyle scores. Our goal is to examine the connection between these two variables and see if I can predict lifestyle scores based on income. By using linear regression, I will find patterns and trends in the data that help us understand how changes in income may influence the lifestyle choices people make. This analysis provides valuable insights into the impact of income on individual lifestyles, which can be useful for making informed decisions and shaping policies that promote well-being.
